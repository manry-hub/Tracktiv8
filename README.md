## Overview

The system integrates with Firebase for authentication and data storage, and provides personalized recommendations based on user input.

    Users can take a quiz to receive recommended career tracks (e.g., Fullstack JavaScript, Backend GoLang, Frontend React, Data Science, Data Analytics, Digital Marketing).

    The system provides direct course links from Hacktiv8 based on the user's selected or recommended career path.
-   **Authentication:**  
    Sign-up and sign-in using Firebase Authentication.

    Uses Next.js (App Router), TailwindCSS, and several custom UI components for a modern, responsive experience.

    Integrated GraniteChatWidget for user support and additional AI-powered assistance.
-   **Personalized Recommendations:**  
    The platform adapts course and track suggestions based on quiz responses and user profile.

    Fully mobile-friendly and accessible layout.
-   **Progress Tracking:**  
    (Planned) Users will be able to track their progress through recommended tracks and courses.

-   **Course and Track Guidance:**  
    The AI can recommend tracks and courses based on user queries, supplementing the quiz system.
-   **Onboarding Help:**  
    New users can interact with the AI widget for step-by-step guidance through the signup and quiz process.
